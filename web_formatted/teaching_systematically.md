By means of quotes, an essay arguing for a unified and systematic method
for education and documentation.

>Le choix n'est donc pas entre le
savoir particulier, précis, limité,
et l'idée générale abstraite. Il est
entre le Deuil et la recherche
d'une méthode qui puisse
articuler ce qui est séparé et relier
ce qui est disjoint.

# Divide and Rule

When a thing accepts many descriptions, this leaves agency
when communicating. And this can be used to either mislead or enlighten,
as examplified by Bernays

>Recently the word Bolshevik 
has performed a similar service for persons who 
wished to frighten the public away from a line of 
action.

And not only an impulsive public, but also individuals. And in fields
known for their rigor, here by the mathematician Bellman

>My first task was to find a name 
for multistage decision processes. 
(...). We had a very interesting gentleman in 
Washington named Wilson. He was Secretary of Defence, and he 
actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word, research.
(...). You can imagine how he felt, then, 
about the term, mathematical. (...) Let's take a word which has an absolutely 
precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. (...) Try 
thinking of some combination which will possibly give it a pejorative 
meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was 
a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object 
to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities.

Many descriptions for one thing not only enable misleadings, but also distantiates disciplines.
A prime example being that of a medical researcher
rediscovering integration and getting a high number of citations

>A Mathematical Model for the
Determination of Total Area
Under Glucose Tolerance and
Other Metabolic Curves

When looking at the current state of higher education, we may have a cynical
view and understand the explosion of disciplines and terms as a by-product of
academia politics.

Divide and rule, because dividing produces specialists, invariably needing
rulers.

Yet an optimistic view could be that consolidating disciplines
requires abstraction tools and models we do not yet possess.

# Unite and Build

>Teaching without a system makes learning difficult

And what if a thing had a 'canonical' description? What if there was a
systematic, standardized approach for describing processes, and anything people
build?

And from Rosenblueth and Wiener, how about focusing on purposes?

>It is apparent from these considerations that although the definition of
purposeful behavior is relatively vague, and hence operationally largely
meaningless, the concept of purpose is useful and should, therefore, be
retained.

What about cross-pollination?

>Fischer’s intellectual formation was instead in physics and mathematics, and
his success in finance came from applying the methods of astrophysics. Lacking the ability
to run controlled experiments on the stars, the astrophysist relies on careful observation and
then imagination to find the simplicity underlying apparent complexity. In Fischer’s hands,
the same habits of research turned out to be effective for producing new knowledge in
finance.

And adapting the language and words used, as abstractions become apparent?

>Therefore, value, just as information, in its general form can be defined as
entropy, given that they are the same mathematically. In the following we will
discuss the properties of this simple analytical theory of value as scarcity.

And most of all, how great would it be if descriptions of engineered systems
could be rigorously defined in a unique way?

>One of our goals in this book is to relate the following diverse topics:
>
>• a generalization of finite group theory which includes finite semi-
>groups and finite state automata;
>
>• a reasonable, precise and useful definition of complexity of organ-
>isms and machines;
>
>• a mathematical theory of physics and/or biology for the case in
>which models are applicable with nonlinear but finite phase spaces.
>Our theory will give rise to the following: relations between the
>Darwinian theory of evolution, the complexity of the evolved or-
>ganisms and the Mendelian genetics;
>
>• a definition of a global (generalized) Lagrangian from which the
>philosophy of Thom’s program for studying morphogenesis (i.e.,
>the origin, development, and evolution of biological structures) via
>the topological methods of the theory of structural stability (`a la
>Smale, Thom, etc.) might begin;
>
>• a Mendeleev type table for the classification of biological reactions
>(e.g., bacterial intermediary metabolism) isomorphic to the classifi-
>cation scheme (`a la Dickson, Chevalley, Thompson, etc.) for simple
>non-abelian groups (SNAGs);
>
>• a mathematical theory of personality including a definition of emo-
>tion which synthesizes the ideas of S. Freud and R. D. Laing;
>
>• a theory of complexity for certain games (in the sense of von Neu-
>mann) which includes Chess, Checkers, Go, etc.

Unite and build, because this bonds people together, building towards the same purpose.
