# ETH Z端rich (2016)

2015 was the year I read about Cybernetics and its history.
One research group that then caught my interest was the [Control Theory and
Systems Biology Laboratory](https://bsse.ethz.ch/ctsb).

Notable experiments I witnessed were around
[antithetic integral feedbacks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1321-1).
My work there was about the
[entrainment of coupled noisy oscillators](/pdfs/EntrainmentOfCoupledNoisyOscillators.pdf).

# ETH Z端rich (2013 - 2015)

After validating the coursework from the [MScQF program](https://www.msfinance.uzh.ch/)
, I reoriented myself towards the
[MSc in mathematics](https://math.ethz.ch/studies/master-programmes/master-mathematics.html).
A focus was machine/statistical learning:

- [Body Movement Recognition](/pdfs/BodyMovementRecognition.pdf) (R) (and elevator pitch)
- [A Review of Some Manifold Learning Algorithms](/pdfs/LaplacianEigenmaps.pdf)
- [Compressed Sensing](/pdfs/CompressedSensing.pdf) (R)

Finally, I bridged some of my theoretical gaps in differential geometry &
functional analysis using my [master thesis](/pdfs/TheLaplaceOperatorOnARiemannianManifold.pdf).

# EPFL (2010 - 2013)

Each year of our [bachelor program](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sb/sma/mathematics-section/studies/bachelor-ma-en) was introducing a new level of abstraction:

- **$Sets$** The reals, vector spaces, the euclidean plane, coordinate systems in mechanics

- **$Sets^{Sets}$** Topological spaces, sigma algebras, quotient algebras

- **$Sets^{Sets}^{Sets}$** Functional analysis, sobolev spaces for finite element methods, PDEs, stochastic processes

And next to the theory, some code, modeling, and writing:

- Simulating a Particule Accelerator (C++)
- Extreme Value Theory Applied on Rainfall Data (R)
- [Numerical Methods for Stochastic ODEs](/pdfs/NumericalMethodsForSDEsAndSDEsWithJumps.pdf) (Matlab)
- The Weighted Majority Algorithm & Constant Rebalanced Portfolios (Matlab)
- [Analysis of Pollen Allergies Through Google Trends Data](/pdfs/AnalysisOfPollenAllergiesThroughGoogleTrendsData.pdf) (R)
- [Mathematical](/pdfs/MMBAssignment2.pdf) [Modeling](/pdfs/MMBAssignment3.pdf)
  of Behavior (Biogeme)
