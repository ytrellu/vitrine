# d-fine (2017 - )

## Zürich

The [IBOR transition](https://www.credit-suisse.com/microsites/ibor/en.html)
has been a main topic for banks in 2020 - 2021. In particular, the secured
lending business of our client was impacted. As a result, I compiled a gap
analysis for their to-be IT-solution. This solution aims at consolidating
various specialized systems, thereby increasing automation potential as well
as decreasing operational errors (risk).

This analysis required cooperation with various units within the bank;
the front office team, the IT team, the market data unit, the quant unit, and
many other stakeholders, similarly affected by the transition.

Finally, my scope extended to the requirement gathering for the loan
origination process.

## Frankfurt / Düsseldorf

The first [Initial Coin Offering](https://ico.savedroid.com/) following German
legislation happened in early 2018. d-fine helped build the infrastructure.
In particular, our team lead [Miguel Vaz](https://de.linkedin.com/in/miguelvaz)
wrote the ethereum smart contracts.

We supported additional ICOs thereafter, as well as STOs. On aggregate, I could

- Write APIs for Ethereum smart-contracts
- Gather information about ICOs to build market knowledge
- Implement a Telegram bot for content moderation & channel stastistics
- Audit, implement, and later help design ethereum smart-contracts
- Provision & deploy code using AWS, Azure, and with Docker
- Integrate payment channels (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Paypal)
- Understand the requirements for a european e-commerce website (cancel &
  returning an order, user management, conversion)
- Custody solutions. 


## Hannover

To meet [BaFin requirements](https://www.bafin.de/EN/Aufsicht/VersichererPensionsfonds/Aufsichtsregime/RechtsgrundlagenLeitlinien/rechtsgrundlagen_node_en.html)
, an insurance company asked us to validate a change
in their internal model. It affected the reinsurance default risk modeling.
This modeling was done using transition matrices between the different rating
classes (e.g. AAA, BB, …).

However the raw estimates were not in line with
typical matrices, so that an additional smoothing was required. We therefore
implemented a generalized linear model in R to smooth the matrices.

## Geneva

Our client, a private bank, was managing its market risk using Front Arena.
The bank had fixed income positions, incl. floating rate notes. Examples of
associated risk measures are Duration, and Convexity. Together with my team,
we validated risk values in Front Arena, often using Bloomberg as reference.

# ETH Zürich (2016)

2015 was also the year I read about Cybernetics and its history.
One research group that then caught my interest was the [Control Theory and
Systems Biology Laboratory](https://bsse.ethz.ch/ctsb).

Notable experiments I witnessed were around
[antithetic integral feedbacks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1321-1).
My work there was about the
[entrainment of coupled noisy oscillators](/pdfs/EntrainmentOfCoupledNoisyOscillators.pdf).

# ETH Zürich (2013 - 2015)

After validating the coursework from the [MScQF program](https://www.msfinance.uzh.ch/)
, I reoriented myself towards the
[MSc in mathematics](https://math.ethz.ch/studies/master-programmes/master-mathematics.html).
A focus was machine/statistical learning:

- [Body Movement Recognition](/pdfs/BodyMovementRecognition.pdf) (R) (and elevator pitch)
- [A Review of Some Manifold Learning Algorithms](/pdfs/LaplacianEigenmaps.pdf)
- [Compressed Sensing](/pdfs/CompressedSensing.pdf) (R)

Finally, I bridged some of my theoretical gaps in differential geometry &
functional analysis using my [master thesis](/pdfs/TheLaplaceOperatorOnARiemannianManifold.pdf).

# EPFL (2010 - 2013)

Each year of our [bachelor program](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sb/sma/mathematics-section/studies/bachelor-ma-en) was introducing a new level of abstraction:

- **$Sets$** The reals, vector spaces, the euclidean plane, coordinate systems in mechanics

- **$Sets^{Sets}$** Topological spaces, sigma algebras, quotient algebras

- **$Sets^{Sets}^{Sets}$** Functional analysis, sobolev spaces for finite element methods, PDEs, stochastic processes

And next to the theory, some code, modeling, and writing:

- Simulating a Particule Accelerator (C++)
- Extreme Value Theory Applied on Rainfall Data (R)
- [Numerical Methods for Stochastic ODEs](/pdfs/NumericalMethodsForSDEsAndSDEsWithJumps.pdf) (Matlab)
- The Weighted Majority Algorithm & Constant Rebalanced Portfolios (Matlab)
- [Analysis of Pollen Allergies Through Google Trends Data](/pdfs/AnalysisOfPollenAllergiesThroughGoogleTrendsData.pdf) (R)
- [Mathematical](/pdfs/MMBAssignment2.pdf) [Modeling](/pdfs/MMBAssignment3.pdf)
  of Behavior (Biogeme)
